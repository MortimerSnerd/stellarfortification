# What is it?

Playing around with the Lobster language

Cloning the Star Castle arcade game as a way to 
give direction while learning the language.

So far, I've found Lobster to be a pretty fun
language to play around in.  I'm probably not
using HOF as much as the language allows, but
I can always review the code at the end and
see if I missed any oportunities to make the code
more clear.

It is surprising how tangled the state can get
for such a simple game.

## Running

You'll need the lobster compiler/interpreter itself, 
which you can get [here](https://github.com/aardappel/lobster)

Then just run:

		lobster sfort.lobster

## Controls

`A` and `D` to turn, `W` to go forward, and 
`Space` to fire.  `Escape` quits.

## Status

The cannon and rings are there. The rings and cannon, 
got can get shot.  The cannon also fires, but doesn't
do anything to the player.

Still need to add the sparks that ride on the rings, 
and harry the player, and a start screen, implement player
death, and lives.
